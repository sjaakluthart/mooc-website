                        <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong> In the last months of 2014 and the first of 2015 we created a MOOC called Prototyping Interaction.The MOOC was based on a course we teach to our students at the program Communication of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam. The MOOC was hosted at Iversity in Berlin. We learned a lot making this MOOC and with this website we like to share our experiences.

                            Make sure the organisation you’re working for backs up your project. In our internal proposal we listed clearly what the benefits of making a MOOC would be for our school.

                                Before you start, you should have an idea of what’s already out there. Research if there are MOOCs or other (online) recources on your subject. Roughly estimate a budget. Write a two page proposal.

                                Find colleagues ( include your students! ) who share the same enthousiasm and vision and get them on board. Hire the skills (e.g. video crew) that are not available from external sources. We worked in a small team of 4 people and hired some extra professionals for visual design, consultation on the assigment, camera and editing. Take some time to do fun things, like having diner together.

                            Preparing videos for a MOOC is more like writing a text than preparing a class. The better structured the content is and the better the instructor already knows what to say before shooting a video, the easier it will be to produce it.

                            Try to make a <a href="">testchapter</a> a soon a possible, because this is where you learn the most of your concept. For us it really helped to find out what worked and what didn't work. Making your ideas tangible in a testchapter as early as possible provides you with enough time to make some major changes. Start with one video, to learn how this works: getting a feel for the video medium. Write a script for the video to structure the content and find a tone of voice. If you are satisfied with the first video, start structuring and scripting the rest.

                                When we were working on our MOOC, writing down the actual texts, assignments and videoscripts, we were changing the structure of the MOOC all the time. So be prepared things may shift and change: it's all for the better! We worked with a whiteboard so we could easily wipe out elements of the structure of our MOOC or change it around.

                                A stand-up is a piece of text someone says on camera, looking in the lense. Telling something to a camera is different then talking to a crowd. Try it out and get accostumed to the camera. Some people are able to give a lecture on camera with just some notes a their side. Others need a script with a the text written out. Try out what's best for you. We used a teleprompter for the standups.

                                Remember a talking head is not the most interesting thing to look at. If infomation comes to a student via ear and eye, he's likely to understand and remember it much better.

                                Organize your project well. Depending on the visual and conptual style of the MOOC you're making, you will end up with a lot of footage. We collected 800 GB of video footage. So be sure your footage and videoprojects are well oganised and everything is well backed up.

                                Do a lot of viewings. Editing is telling a story. To make sure the editor is telling the story you want to put across, watch the rough edited parts so do a lot of viewings. We did all the editing ourselves but even then we were checking all the time with two persons if the edit was going in the right direction. If you look at something with at least two people, ideas come up and the story evolves through the conversation.
