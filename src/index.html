          <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong> In the last months of 2014 and the first of 2015 we created a MOOC called Prototyping Interaction.The MOOC was based on a course we teach to our students at the program Communication of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam. The MOOC was hosted at Iversity in Berlin. We learned a lot making this MOOC and with this website we like to share our experiences.

              Before you start, you should have an idea of what’s already out there. Research if there are MOOCs or other (online) recources on your subject. Roughly estimate a budget. Write a two page proposal.

                Find colleagues ( include your students! ) who share the same enthousiasm and vision and get them on board. Hire the skills (e.g. video crew) that are not available from external sources. We worked in a small team of 4 people and hired some extra professionals for visual design, consultation on the assigment, camera and editing. Take some time to do fun things, like having diner together.

              Preparing videos for a MOOC is more like writing a text than preparing a class. The better structured the content is and the better the instructor already knows what to say before shooting a video, the easier it will be to produce it.

              Try to make a <a href="">testchapter</a> a soon a possible, because this is where you learn the most of your concept. For us it really helped to find out what worked and what didn't work. Making your ideas tangible in a testchapter as early as possible provides you with enough time to make some major changes. Start with one video, to learn how this works: getting a feel for the video medium. Write a script for the video to structure the content and find a tone of voice. If you are satisfied with the first video, start structuring and scripting the rest.

So be prepared things may shift and change: it's all for the better! We worked with a whiteboard so we could easily wipe out elements of the structure of our MOOC or change it around.

                A stand-up is a piece of text someone says on camera, looking in the lense. Telling something to a camera is different then talking to a crowd. Try it out and get accostumed to the camera. Some people are able to give a lecture on camera with just some notes a their side. Others need a script with a the text written out. Try out what's best for you. We used a teleprompter for the standups.

              <p>
                Do a lot of viewings. Editing is telling a story. To make sure the editor is telling the story you want to put across, watch the rough edited parts so do a lot of viewings. We did all the editing ourselves but even then we were checking all the time with two persons if the edit was going in the right direction. If you look at something with at least two people, ideas come up and the story evolves through the conversation.

              Every MOOC platform has it's own content management system. Try to learn how it works and what the possibilities are beforehand.

              <h1>Action: getting to know the back-end</h1>
              <p>
                Be sure you start well ahead with placing all the course material on the platform. Take some time to get to know the system, it's possibilities and it's limitations. For example, we found out during the platform placement that the preview chapter could only contain 3 movieclips, while we made 5 clips. Be prepared that some innovative concepts you've developed, might not be supported by the the backend of the MOOC platform you're on.

              <h1>Action: monotoring feedback</h1>
              <p>During the time the course is running, it's important to keep monitoring feedback on the forums and deal with questions and complaints. Try to do this on a regular base so students do not feel they are only dealing with a virtual learning environment. After all, students like to get feedback on their work.</p>

                In our case, we let the students work on a project, spread out over the weeks the course was published. The project itself consists of four assigments, and are to be collected in a portfolio. We reviewed this portfolio on the basis of the learning goals and criteria. Be very clear in communicating these criteria beforehand. If the portfolio's or final exams are... too much for yourself to handle, get help from the MOOC platform, student assistents and fellow instructors. Some MOOCs provide only peer feedback, so you don't need to review students at all.
